        Well, it all began when I was 17 watching some YouTube videos on how to get started in IT. A lot of channels recommended starting with CompTIA A+ certificate, and from there choose which path to take. I liked the idea of being a sysadmin, so I started studying for the A+ certificate.

        Unfortunately I didn't pass the exam on my first try. And not on a second try either. On a second try I was this close to passing: ü§è. I just needed 675 points to pass, and I got 639, which is just 3 questions of difference. For an exam that consists of 90 questions, this difference was microscopic. Also, maybe at that time my English wasn't perfect. I mean it wasn't bad, but for the A+ exam that had questions specifically designed to confuse you.. Well for that my English probably wasn't enough.

        Who knows maybe I will return and take my revenge on this A+ exam, now that my knowledge is a lot bigger and my English skills are also better. Anyways, when I failed on the second try, I decided to not waste any more money on it, and essentially I gave up.

        Now I'm 19, and one day I just had this idea of trying again in IT, but this time in programming. I had friends that were programmers and they convinced me to give it another try. A quick search on YouTube, a couple of videos, and I started learning the most beginner friendly programming language. Python. But since programming is a huge field and I didn't know where to start, I decided to take a course. Because it will have a roadmap that will help alot. And well, there is this course called Harvard CS50. In which I enrolled. Because it's absolutely beginner friendly. And easy. Right? Right??..

        It was anything but easy. I mean yes, the first lectures were indeed easy. Like "what does the 'print' function do?" But it went 0 to 100 real quick. From print statements to uploading your console program to GitHub using a virtual IDE connected through an OAuth token in a blink of an eye. Right now it doesn't sound difficult, but when it's your first time doing this your motivation can die pretty quickly. And keep in mind I was doing it without ChatGPT. So after doing around 1/3 of the course I decided to stop and find another course which won't have this steep learning curve. And maybe switch to another programming language. While I was looking for other courses, I met a guy who was a senior developer in C#, C++ and Java. He recommended me a Java course named Javarush, or also known as CodeGym. 1 year long course that teaches everything, from the very basics to popular Java frameworks. And so the journey with Java started.

        The transition from Python to Java was rough. Because I got used to the simplcity of just typing print, and did not understand why do I need to create an entire class, why should I write these "public static void main(String[] args)" things and why do I need to put a semicolon at the end of each line. Like why overcomplicate things?! Now I know. While Python may seem simpler at first, when dealing with large projects Java's verbosity helps maintain clarity and structure. Java is like Switzerland. Yes you need a lot of paperwork for rather simple things, but this also means safety and stability. With time I got used to Java and learned to appreciate its strengths. And now I can say that I like Java. It's a great programming language. If you have noticed, the domain of this website is psvm.blog which stands for "public static void main" which is the entry point of any Java application. So yeah, I really like Java.

        Time passed, and meanwhile I decided to move to Switzerland. New country, new language, lots of paperwork. Of course I didn't have time for the studies and by the time I did, the group was far ahead of me. Since I already finished with Java syntax and OOP, I took a quick look where the group was at that time. They were studying frameworks, specifically Spring. I decided to now study on my own without the courses. And skip the theory part, rather learn by doing. Just me, Java and ChatGPT. While the group was submitting some simple homework to practice the framework, my decision was to build a real world project. From 0. With database, frontend, backend, deployment, everything. For the first time. And so I did. The next blog post will be about this project. See ya!
